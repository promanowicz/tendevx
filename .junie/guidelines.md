# Project Guidelines

This is vueJS 3 project with TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, Playwright and ESLint.
It uses google Firebase for authentication and Firestore for data storage.

App provides AI features, currently using OpenAI API but when creating
code, keep in mind that it can be replaced with any other AI API.

When creating new views, use Vue 3 Composition API.

In communication with Firestore always use typescript classes,
so firestore data stays concise and coherent.

Keep code style consistent across the project.
