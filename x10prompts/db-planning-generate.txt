# Firease initialization

This document provides a reproducible guide to create the necessary file structure for integrating Firestore and Auth into project.

Follow strictly the firestore database plan described in `/ai/db-plan.md`.


## Prerequisites

- Project use Vue 3,  TypeScript 5, Pinia and firebase version 11.9.1
- Firebase dependency is already installed in project.
- Generate all needed collection and document types in /src/db/database.types.ts file.
- Ensure that a file `/src/db/database.types.ts` exists and contains the correct type definitions for your database.

IMPORTANT: Check prerequisites before perfoming actions below. If they're not met, stop and ask a user for the fix.

## File Structure and Setup

### 1. Firestore Client Initialization

Create the file `/src/db/firebase.client.ts` with the following content:

```ts
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

// TODO: Replace the following with your app's Firebase project configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
    FIREBASE_CONFIGURATION
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);


// Initialize Cloud Firestore and get a reference to the service
const db = getFirestore(app);

// Initialize Firebase Authentication and get a reference to the service
const auth = getAuth(app);
```

This file initializes the Firestore and Auth client using the environment variable `VUE_FIREBASE_CONFIG`.

No middleware is needed for firebase use.
